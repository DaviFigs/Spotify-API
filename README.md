Hi!
This project was inspired by an app called ReceiptFy
This app use the same API to serve for users, the data of them spotify accounts,
we use this data to show them things like, Top Songs, Top Artists and other stuffs.

I don't kwnow what kind of technologies they use at receiptfy, but my app is build in:
--Python, Django and Celery
Perhaps I'll make this project again, using less complex technologies, like Flask or FastAPI.
